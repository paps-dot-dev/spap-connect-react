			'I collaborated with Equature to migrate their website from WordPress to a custom-built Next.js platform. The project involved designing and developing a new website that integrates HubSpot as the content management system, allowing all content on the website to be easily editable. The site also incorporates WordPress and Google API integrations to enhance functionality and user experience. The new platform provides better scalability, improved site performance, and a streamlined editing experience, resulting in a more modern and dynamic online presence for Equature.',
